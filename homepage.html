            <p class="para1">
                Phishing is when attackers attempt to trick users into doing 'the wrong thing', 
                such as clicking a bad link that will download malware, or direct them to a dodgy website.
                <br>Phishing can be conducted via a text message, social media, or by phone, but the term 'phishing' is mainly used to describe 
                attacks that arrive by email. Phishing emails can reach millions of users directly, and hide amongst the huge number of benign 
                emails that busy users receive. Attacks can install malware (such as ransomware), sabotage systems, or steal intellectual
                property and money.

                                <br>Are you confident that none of your employees would click on a link from an email that claims to be your paper supply company? That's why educating employees about phishing scams is essential. Employees need to know how to prevent this cybercrime before it's too late.<br>
                                <br>Learn through simulated phishing and social engineering campaigns like spear phishing which is a calculated and advanced attack targeted at specific individuals. These tend to be highly effective without proper training, and all you have to do is click on a link for it to work. Continuously repeat the process and raise more awareness and develop a skeptical eye among your staff, and prevent the success of phishing emails in the future.</p>

It's excellent to be mindful as a business owner or manager, but if a criminal gets into your network through any computer in your system, then it's all the same. Your employees are your biggest vulnerability, but they can also be your greatest defense against phishing attempts. However, it requires experience to recognize and report phishing attempts. Nothing teaches like experience.</p>

            <h1 align="Center">Real World Phishing Examples</h1>
            <h2>Classic Phishing Email</h2>
            <p>Over the past few years online service providers have been stepping up their security game by messaging customers when they detect unusual or worrisome activity on their users' accounts. Not surprisingly, threat actors are using this to their advantage. Many are designed poorly with bad grammar, etc. but others look legitimate enough for someone to click if they weren't paying close attention:
               Consider this fake Paypal security notice warning potential marks of "unusual log in activity" on their accounts. Hovering over the links would be enough to stop you from ending up on a credentials stealing website. The first example is a fake Microsoft notice, almost identical in appearance to an actual notice from Microsoft concerning "Unusual sign-in activity". The second example email points users to a phony 1-800 number instead of kicking users to a credentials phish.

            <h2>Infected Attachments</h2>
            <p>Malicious .HTML attachments aren't seen as often as .JS or .DOC file attachments, but they are desirable for a couple of reasons. First, there is a low chance of antivirus detection since .HTML files are not commonly associated with email-borne attacks. Second, .HTML attachments are commonly used by banks and other financial institutions so people are used to seeing them in their inboxes. Here are a few examples of credential phishes we've seen using this attack vector.
            </p>
            <img src="Images/infected attachments 1.png" alt="" width="1250px">
            <p>Malicious macros in phishing emails have become an increasingly common way of delivering ransomware in the past year. These documents too often get past antivirus programs with no problem. The phishing emails contain a sense of urgency for the recipient and as you can see in the below screenshot, the documents step users through the process. If users fail to enable the macros, the attack is unsuccessful.
            </p>

            <h2>CEO Fraud Scams</h2>
            <p>
                Here's an example of a KnowBe4 customer being a target for CEO fraud. The employee initially responded, then remembered her training and instead reported the email using the Phish Alert Button, alerting her IT department to the fraud attempt.
                When the employee failed to proceed with the wire transfer, she got another email from the cybercriminals, who probably thought it was payday:
